## Introduction
So what is this? A blog/personal website for me (Minh or you can call `momoclouq`)  
A few basic information about me: Im a fullstack (web) developer focusing on Javascript-related technologies such as React, Express, ...  
Despite having a fulltime job for a while now, I just started working on a "portfolio" website recently ðŸ« . This website is only for displaying my thoughts and work.  
I will not focus much on this in a technological view (not using the best tools/practices). So dont expect too much from this codebase. ðŸ«   
There will be anime memes, references as Im considered to be a **weebo** in normal standards. ðŸ¤¡

Lets get started

## Technology choices
What did I pick to run this project and why? CRA (create-react-app), MDX and styled-components (CSS)  
At first I liked to use something newer to me: Gatsby as the power of generating static sites suit the concept perfectly. 
But I would want to save a few bucks on hosting/endpoint money so I chose the safe solution: **CRA** with deployment using **free Github Pages** ðŸ˜¢  
For **MDX**, I just found out about this awesome technique to create sites using **markdown** so I must try it out ~.~  
The scope of this site is about blogging and showcasing my projects, so **styled-components** was used as the UI is needed minimally.  

## Creation process
For anyone who is not familiar with the web development world, [React](https://reactjs.org/) is one of the best tool (using Javascript) to start creating modern websites these days.  
And [Create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) is a tool created by Facebook to help the process of setting up a project much faster.  

Following the tutorials of these tools can help you create a template for many websites. So what is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)?  
Most of the time when you want to create basic websites for text contents, you would have to work with HTML or JSX files directly (in case you dont have a backend running!). But markdown 
has always been a better, more intuitive way to write documents. So why dont we add markdown to Javascript (in this case JSX files). That is where MDX comes in. ðŸ’°  

It integrates JSX and markdown together.  

Following the guides in the document [getting started](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/#create-react-app-cra), you will have to install another package [craco](https://github.com/dilanx/craco/blob/master/packages/craco/README.md) 
to get the repo working correctly with CRA 5 and above for the time being. And you can start creating and using `.mdx` files like a normal components in React!

If you need help with a cheatsheet in Markdown: [markdown cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)  

The next thing I want to do with the project is adding [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you can consider it as an extension of Javascript that adds type support for the language.
I recommend you to use Typescript in every project as it is essential in modern day Javascript development. The setting up process can be found here: [Adding typescript to react app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/). 
If there are errors, you may need to create a `.tsconfig.json` file in your repo, just type your error on Google and you will find the easy solution, [What I need when configure adding images to the repo](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include). ðŸ¤”  

There are a few minor things that you would need for this project: 
- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial): It will be sooner or later that you will find out about the nature of CRA, how would you navigate to another endpoint within your app? That is where react-router came in. 
Just follow the tutorial and you will be good, but I have to rant. Why the hell react-router must change its syntax in every major versions? ðŸ˜’ I was surprised about the tutorial as It is entirely different from what I learned a few months ago???  
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started): This is a wonderful library that helps with packaging CSS in components and re-using css codes without mananging enormous CSS files. It just provides another way to write CSS, not a full-fledged UI library like MUI or Bootstrap. 
I personally thinks that a project of this size does not need those fancy libraries, and showcasing UI skills is not the scope of this project. [Some tricks to style Link component of react router](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-style-react-router-links-styled-components/)  

The structure of the repo is also important (at least to me ðŸ˜¥). You can check it out at the Github repo for this project.  

> Now I can start writing blog posts!!!

### What are the tips about using MDX?
1. You should use normal React components for items that changes with input (props)
2. You should use `.mdx` for contents that are long and unrepetitive (like a post)
3. You should separate the React components from the MDX files as much as possible, if you found yourself using 70% or more of your code writing React component in a `.mdx` then you should probably use a normal React component~

## Deploy on Github pages

## Thoughts
The process of creating a personal blog website is now coming to an end as the next part of this project is to **create posts**. If there are anything related to tech updated 
then I will update this page accordingly! It has been fun creating this website, I learned a lot about MDX ðŸ¥¹.  
I think that this is a rather simple blog website with simple UI focusing more on repo structure than the actual technologies. But I hope you can still learn something from it.  
The link to the Github repo is below and I hope to see you again in the next posts.
